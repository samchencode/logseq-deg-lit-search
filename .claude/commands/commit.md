# Commit Changes

Commit the current changes to git with a descriptive message.

## Instructions

1. Run `git status` to see what files have been modified, added, or deleted
2. Run `git diff --staged` and `git diff` to understand the actual changes
3. Stage all changes with `git add -A`
4. Create a commit with a descriptive message that:
   - Summarizes what was changed in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Is concise but informative
   - For single file changes: focus on what changed in that file
   - For multiple files: summarize the overall change or list key modifications
5. Show the resulting commit hash and message to confirm success
