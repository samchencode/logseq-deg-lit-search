- Specifically, in contrast to routine radiotherapy for breast cancer delivered in totality following surgery, we **delivered a small portion of radiotherapy preoperatively** to the tumor itself in lieu of postoperative radiotherapy to the tumor bed (commonly referred to as a boost) ([Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124725004747#fig1)A).
- The rest of the radiotherapy was delivered following surgery.
- In brief, 7 days before surgical resection, radiotherapy-naive patients received one of two biologically equivalent dose regiments of radiotherapy ([STAR Methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124725004747#sec8)).
