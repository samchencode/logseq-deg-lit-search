- Search patterns for finding qualifying papers
- Observations
	- Most pre/post RT studies are chemoradiotherapy (CRT) - need to filter carefully
	- Cell line studies are common but excluded (need "patients" or "biopsy" keywords)
	- [[SBRT]] / stereotactic radiotherapy studies often use radiation alone
	- Conference abstracts (ASCO, ASTRO) may have unpublished paired data
	- Search by cancer type + SBRT yields better radiation-only results
	- Keywords that help: "paired samples", "neoadjuvant SBRT", "paired biopsy"
	- Keywords to avoid: "chemoradiotherapy", "CRT", "concurrent"
	- GBM nearly always uses Stupp protocol (RT + temozolomide) - rarely RT alone
	- Cervical cancer typically uses brachytherapy + chemo - rarely RT alone
	- Esophageal cancer usually uses CCRT - hard to find RT alone
	- Rectal cancer: short-course RT exists but often combined with chemo
	- Best RT-alone sources: SBRT for prostate, lung, liver mets
