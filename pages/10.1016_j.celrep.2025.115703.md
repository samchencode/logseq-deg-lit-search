- # The impact of breast radiotherapy on the tumor genome and immune ecosystem
- ## Study Design
  id:: 694c2c27-31d5-4116-bf3f-5d4e5f54b274
- Neoadjuvant radiotherapy monotherapy (no concurrent chemotherapy)
- ER+ (estrogen-receptor positive) breast cancer
- 20 patients total
- Paired biopsies: pre-radiotherapy and 7 days post-radiotherapy
- Single-cell analysis of tumor genetics and immune microenvironment
- ## Methodology
- Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq): 8 patients analyzed
- Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq): 11 patients analyzed
- Both at two timepoints (pre-RT and 7d post-RT)
- ## Key Findings
- Increased infiltration of naive-like CD4 T cells following radiotherapy
- Early, activated CD8 T cell population appeared post-RT
- Radiotherapy eliminated existing cytotoxic T cells
- Increased myeloid cell infiltration
- Changes in tumor genomic selection patterns
