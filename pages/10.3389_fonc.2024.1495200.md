- A total of 8 patients received radiotherapy alone and 15 patients received a combination of radio-chemotherapy,
- Tumor tissue samples were collected from all participants who received radiotherapy to perform the **whole exome (WES) and transcriptome (WTS) sequencing** and matched peripheral blood samples which included three-time points, **pre-treatment, on-treatment, and post-treatment** were collected to perform the TCR-βsequencing.
	- Wait so just the blood samples were collected at 3 time points?
