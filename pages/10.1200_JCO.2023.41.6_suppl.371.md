- Transcriptomic profiles were generated using Decipher GRID (Veracyte, Inc).

	- Transcriptomic profiles were generated using Decipher GRID (Veracyte, Inc). Differences in transcriptional signatures were assessed between Bx samples taken before treatment and RP samples post-treatment using a paired T-Test. A control cohort of transcriptomic profiles of 803 untreated Bx samples and matching RP samples from the same patients were used to account for differential effects in tissue preservation between Bx and RP. Linear regression model with the interaction effect of cohort (SBRT vs control) and by treatment status (Bx vs RP) to select signatures significantly impacted by neoadjuvant SBRT. Signatures with interaction p-value <0.01 and paired T-test value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
