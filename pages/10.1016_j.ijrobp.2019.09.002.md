- Patients were treated with preoperative RT (10 × 4 Gy in 10 days or 5 × 6 Gy in 5 days) and a lumpectomy 6 weeks thereafter. The response of the tumor to RT was evaluated by pathologic assessment. To analyze the gene expression data, unsupervised and supervised clustering was performed.
- Gene expression profiles were compared between biopsies of responders and nonresponders and between samples **before and after RT.**
- Ninety-four samples from 77 patients were analyzed: 68 pretreatment biopsies and 26 post-RT surgery specimens
	- So the question is how many had both pre and post RT RNAseq? (based on above numbers should be 17?)
- Before treatment, 3 core biopsies of the tumor were taken for histopathologic evaluation and translational research.
- Patients were treated with preoperative RT, and a wide local excision guided by a tumor marker was **performed 6 weeks after irradiation**. The radiation schedule initially consisted of 10 fractions of 4 Gy in 2 weeks and changed to 5 fractions of 6 Gy in 1 week, which is an isoeffective schedule.
- For all patients, an MRI scan was performed before RT and again 6 weeks later, before surgery.
- A positron emission tomography scan at the same time points was optional. All patients gave written informed consent.

- Response to Preoperative Radiation Therapy in Relation to Gene Expression Patterns in Breast Cancer Patients
- ## Study Design
- Preoperative radiation monotherapy (no concurrent chemotherapy)
- Low-risk invasive breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma)
- Two RT schedules: 10×4 Gy in 10 days OR 5×6 Gy in 5 days
- 77 patients total
- 94 samples analyzed: 68 pretreatment biopsies and 26 post-RT surgery specimens
- ## Methodology
- RNA-seq using next-generation sequencing
- Unsupervised and supervised clustering performed
- Comparative DEG analysis between responders and nonresponders to RT
- ## Key Findings
- Significant gene expression alterations occurred post-treatment
- Pathways involved: p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, inflammatory pathways
- No clinically significant differences in gene expression between patients with and without response to RT
- ## Data Availability
