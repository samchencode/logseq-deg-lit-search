- Patients were treated with preoperative RT (10 × 4 Gy in 10 days or 5 × 6 Gy in 5 days) and a lumpectomy 6 weeks thereafter. The response of the tumor to RT was evaluated by pathologic assessment. To analyze the gene expression data, unsupervised and supervised clustering was performed. Gene expression profiles were compared between biopsies of responders and nonresponders and between samples before and after RT.

- Response to Preoperative Radiation Therapy in Relation to Gene Expression Patterns in Breast Cancer Patients
- ## Study Design
- Preoperative radiation monotherapy (no concurrent chemotherapy)
- Low-risk invasive breast cancer (including ductal carcinoma)
- Two RT schedules: 10×4 Gy in 10 days OR 5×6 Gy in 5 days
- 77 patients total
- 94 samples analyzed: 68 pretreatment biopsies and 26 post-RT surgery specimens
- ## Methodology
- RNA-seq using next-generation sequencing
- Unsupervised and supervised clustering performed
- Comparative DEG analysis between responders and nonresponders to RT
- ## Key Findings
- Significant gene expression alterations occurred post-treatment
- Pathways involved: p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, inflammatory pathways
- No clinically significant differences in gene expression between patients with and without response to RT
- ## Data Availability
