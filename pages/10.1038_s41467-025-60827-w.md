- Enrolled patients undergo biopsies pre-treatment and **immediately after the last fraction** of radiotherapy in the clinic setting.
- Approximately **6 weeks after completion** of radiation, patients are taken for definitive resection of residual disease with an additional research-specific biopsy at the time of surgery.
- As above, biopsy samples were triaged for translational studies. However, for the HyPR-HN study, **samples were prioritized first for single-cell sequencing**. After single-cell suspensions were processed for sequencing, the remaining cells from the sample underwent mFC.
- In cases with additional sufficient tissue samples, separate pieces were preserved for mIF, **bulk RNA sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics.**
	- So only where there was sufficient tissue?

	- Looks like only patient 2 had bulk RNA seq

	- But everyone got single cell sequencing of RNA
