- 5-Fluorouracil and cisplatin (CDDP) combined with 41.4 Gy/23 fr were used for preoperative RT.
	- Looks like they got chemo: 5-FU/Cisplatin
- Endoscopic biopsies were performed before, during, just after, and following RT, and tissue samples were obtained from a minimum of two different time points.
- To understand the temporal changes in gene expression profile in the TME by RT at the single-cell level, **scRNA-seq was performed in biopsy samples obtained “pre-RT,” “during RT,” “just after RT (7 days after RT),” and “after RT (~1 month after RT)”** (the detailed definition of timing for these groups is shown in [Fig. 3A](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh9069#) and fig. S6A) (N.B.; 11 biopsy samples were obtained from five ESCC patients).
