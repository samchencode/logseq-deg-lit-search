- They **did not** collect samples *before* radiation and then again *after* radiation from the same breast.
  
  **All RNA-seq samples were collected after radiation therapy (RT).**
  
  The comparison is **irradiated tissue vs. non-irradiated tissue at the same post-RT time point**, using the contralateral breast as the control.
  
  Here’s how we can tell from the methods you pasted:
- ### What they actually did
- Tissue was collected **during removal of tissue expanders and placement of implants**, which happens **after completion of radiation therapy**.
- For each patient, they sampled:
	- **Irradiated breast tissue** (within the radiation field)
	- **Contralateral non-irradiated breast tissue** from the corresponding anatomical location
- RNA-seq was then performed on these post-RT samples.
  
  This makes the design **paired, cross-sectional**, not longitudinal.

- During the **removal of tissue expanders and placement of silicone implants and/or autologous tissue**, three different tissue types were collected from non-irradiated and irradiated breasts. Skin samples were taken centrally from the mastectomy scar. Muscle samples were obtained from the underlying pectoralis major muscle. If muscle was not found directly under the mastectomy scar, it was taken from a point superior to the incision within the radiation field. A capsule sample was taken from around the expander directly inferior to the mastectomy scar ([Fig 1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0316443#pone-0316443-g001)). In all cases, samples were taken from the radiated field and the corresponding location in the contralateral breast. Tissue samples were immediately submerged in RNAlater™ (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), stored at 4°C overnight, and subsequently stored at −80°C until further use. Additional fresh tissue samples were frozen and stored at − 80°C for histopathological analyses.

- TLDR:
	- Self-controlled design using contralateral breast as pre-RT baseline
