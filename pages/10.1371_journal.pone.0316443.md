# Understanding early molecular changes associated with radiation therapy—A preliminary bulk RNA sequencing study

## Study Design
- Unilateral breast irradiation monotherapy (no concurrent chemotherapy)
- Breast cancer patients
- 7 patients total
- Paired tissue samples: pre-radiotherapy (contralateral breast as control) and post-radiotherapy (irradiated breast) at median 133 days post-RT
- Tissues analyzed: skin, muscle, capsule

## Methodology
- Bulk RNA sequencing
- DEG analysis performed
- Self-controlled design using contralateral breast as pre-RT baseline

## Key Findings
- Preliminary identification of molecular changes associated with radiation therapy
- DEG analysis reveals early transcriptional alterations in irradiated tissues
- Potential insights into radiation-induced gene expression in non-tumor tissues

## Data Availability
Public data available (GSE278183)
