- We generated GEPs for 53 patients from biopsies taken prior to preoperative radiotherapy.
- Differential gene expression analysis was performed using statistical analysis of microarrays, pathway enrichment analysis and immune cell type analysis using single sample gene set enrichment analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate specific results. The results were validated using 220 pretreatment samples from publicly available datasets at metalevel of pathway and survival analyses.
