# RNAseq Literature Review Project

This project is a Logseq graph for systematically collecting and organizing literature on differential gene expression (DEG) studies comparing pre- and post-radiation therapy (RT) in human cancer patients using RNAseq.

## Overview

The goal is to identify and catalog qualifying papers that meet specific inclusion criteria (human subjects, radiation monotherapy, RNAseq pre/post RT, DEG analysis). Each paper is stored as a page with standardized attributes (e.g., tags, authors, n, dose, etc.) for easy querying and analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Logseq**: A privacy-first, open-source knowledge management and note-taking application that uses local Markdown files to create linked databases (graphs) for organizing notes, pages, and journals.
- **opencode**: CLI tool for software engineering tasks.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>  # Replace with actual URL if hosted online
cd fiddle-claude  # Or the cloned directory name
```

### Open in Logseq
1. Download and install Logseq from [logseq.com](https://logseq.com).
2. Open Logseq.
3. Click "Add new graph" or "Open a local directory".
4. Select the cloned directory (`logseq-deg-lit-search
`).
5. The graph will load with pages, journals, and links.

### Install opencode
opencode is a CLI tool for software engineering tasks. To install:
1. Visit [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai) for installation instructions.
2. Follow the setup guide to configure it for your environment.

To open the opencode CLI in this project directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/logseq-deg-lit-search  # Replace with actual path
opencode
```
Use commands like `/help` for assistance with tasks.

### What is AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md?
These files contain instructions and guidelines primarily for AI agents (not human collaborators) to read and execute. However, both humans and AI can write or edit them for updates. They outline workflows, naming conventions, search strategies, and how to add new papers or update the database. Humans should review them for context but follow the main README for user instructions.

## Project Structure
- **`pages/`**: User-created pages, including individual paper pages (e.g., `10.1371_journal.pone.0316443.md`) with attributes.
- **`journals/`**: Daily journal entries logging searches and findings (e.g., `2025_12_23.md`).
- **`logseq/`**: Backup and versioned pages.
- **`AGENTS.md`**: Collaboration guidelines.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Additional notes or AI interactions.
- **`.git/`**: Git repository for version control.

## Workflow
1. Review `AGENTS.md` for criteria and procedures.
2. Search for papers using PubMed, etc.
3. If qualifying: Create a page in `pages/` with DOI as filename and standardized attributes.
4. Log the search in `journals/yyyy_MM_dd.md`.
5. Use Logseq to query and link papers (e.g., by tags like `[[paper]]`).

## Contributing
Follow the guidelines in `AGENTS.md`. Use git for version control (commit changes, create branches for major updates). For help with opencode or Logseq, refer to their documentation.

For questions, check `AGENTS.md` or create an issue in the repo.
